Movie Data Collection Project

This mini-project focuses on searching for movies and integrating the collected data into a database. It involves:
Movie Search: Develop a mechanism to search for movies based on various criteria (title, genre and year).
Data Collection: Extract relevant information from the search results and extract top 5 most popular search data.
Database Integration: Store the collected movie data in a structured database for efficient organization and retrieval.
This project can be a valuable tool for building a movie database for personal use or further analysis.

Getting Started
This section will provide instructions on how to set up and run the project. It will include details on:

Prerequisites (e.g., Python libraries(mysql.connector, tabulate, re, datetime, dotenv and pathlib),
database installation(sqlite3)).
constant.py will include db-requests, exceptions and a long-read for users choice.
Database credentials inside .env file and included in .gitignore by classics.
requirements.txt includes important libs for more tools. Nothing much... Very simple project to deploy:)

Running the project
Using the collected movie data

The project can be extended in several ways, including:

Implementing a user interface for easier movie search and data management.
Expanding the search criteria to include additional movie attributes (e.g., ratings, awards).
These enhancements can make the project more user-friendly and provide deeper insights into the movie data.
